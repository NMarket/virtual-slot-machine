A 3D slot machine game that runs in the browser.

Only html5 web standards are used, so no need for flash or any such nonsense. It does require a fairly modern browser though. I've tested it with Chrome and Firefox.

I wrote Virtual Slot Machine to help me learn the excellent JavaScript 3D library [three.js](http://threejs.org/)
