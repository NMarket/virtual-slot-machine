- Export the wheel into the js folder, calling it wheel.json. (See image in this folder for the export options you should use).
- After exporting the json file will need editing to ensure that the texture will load. This is because the path for the texture will be wrong.
- Open wheel.json and search for the line containing: `"mapDiffuse": "wheel.png",`
- Change it to "mapDiffuse": `"../images/wheel.png",` and save the file.
